# Project Overview: Gemini CLI Configuration

This directory serves as a configuration and setup environment for the Gemini Command Line Interface (CLI). It contains various configuration files and scripts primarily focused on integrating and managing services with the Gemini CLI, particularly for Multi-Cloud Platform (MCP) setups.

## Directory Structure and Key Files:

*   `.gemini/`: This directory contains configurations specific to the Gemini CLI.
    *   `commands/settings.json`: Configures the Multi-Cloud Platform (MCP) servers, including details for a Supabase integration (e.g., command to run the server, arguments, and environment variables like `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`).
*   `.specify/`: This directory likely holds specifications or templates related to the project's setup or code generation.
*   `.github/`: Contains GitHub-related configurations, potentially including workflows or issue templates. The `.gitignore` indicates an `instructions` subdirectory, which might hold documentation for GitHub actions or similar.
*   `.codacy/`: This directory is likely used for Codacy code analysis configurations and logs.
*   `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore, including sensitive information like personal access tokens and local environment files, as well as tool-specific directories like `.gemini`, `.specify`, and `.codacy`.

## Usage:

This project is intended to configure and manage the Gemini CLI environment. The `settings.json` file, in particular, is crucial for defining how the Gemini CLI interacts with external services like Supabase. Developers or users working with the Gemini CLI would interact with these configuration files to customize their development environment and service integrations.

To understand specific commands or workflows, further investigation into the scripts within `.gemini/commands/` (beyond `settings.json`) and `.specify/scripts/` would be necessary.
